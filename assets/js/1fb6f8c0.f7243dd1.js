Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User\u2019s device as they interact with this Application.\nFor simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document \u2013 unless there is a reason to differentiate. For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.\nSome of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User\'s consent, depending on the applicable law. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.\nThis Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called \u201cfirst-party\u201d Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called \u201cthird-party\u201d Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them. The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the User\u2019s browsing session. In addition to what\u2019s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information \u2013 such as the presence of other Trackers - in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.'),(0,o.kt)("h3",{id:"activities-strictly-necessary-for-the-operation-of-this-application-and-delivery-of-the-service"},"Activities strictly necessary for the operation of this Application and delivery of the Service"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"This Application uses so-called \u201ctechnical\u201d Cookies and other similar Trackers to carry out activities that are strictly necessary for the operation or delivery of the Service."),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"other-activities-involving-the-use-of-trackers"},"Other activities involving the use of Trackers"),(0,o.kt)("h3",{id:"basic-interactions--functionalities"},"Basic interactions & functionalities"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"This Application uses Trackers to enable basic interactions and functionalities, allowing Users to access selected features of the Service and facilitating the User's communication with the Owner.\nInteraction with External Social Networks and Platforms\nThis type of service allows interaction with social networks or other external platforms directly from the pages of this Application.
