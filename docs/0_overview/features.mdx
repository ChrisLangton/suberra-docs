## Gasless Transactions

Transactions on Suberra are gasless\*, and your customers do not have to pay gas fees to approve, pay or subscribe to a merchant on Suberra Network.

Gasless transactions (meta transactions) are transactions in which the gas cost is abstracted and paid by Suberra, rather than by the customer. Gasless transactions help to provide a smoother experience for customers and enable them to make payments easier without having to bridge or set aside gas tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc) manually.

- Only available to selected tokens and chains. Gasless transactions will be available for $USDC on Polygon, Avalanche and Arbitrum network initially.

### Why canâ€™t we have gasless transactions for all tokens?

As gasless transactions rely on the ERC20 permit extensions (defined in EIP-2612), it is only available on ERC20 tokens that support the standard.

Currently, gasless transactions are available only for $USDC.
